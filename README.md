## Shortly about myself

I am a computer systems professional by education with 22 years of experience in various IT fields, both in the private and public sectors.
I rarely encountered programming in my work. But thanks to a coincidence, I had the opportunity to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
Having successfully completed the intensive course, I already have 2 years of commercial experience building web applications on Ruby on Rails and front-end on Bootstrap.
