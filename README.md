## Shortly about myself

Hi, my name is Maxim. I am a systems analyst engineer with 20 years of experience in various IT fields in both the private and public sector. I rarely encountered programming in my work. But by a rare coincidence, I had a chance to study Ruby and Ruby on Rails and my choice fell on a course from super cool guys, developers and mentors - [Goodprogrammer](https://goodprogrammer.ru). Having successfully completed their intensive course, I can firmly call myself a RoR developer! The projects, as always, can be found on [GitHUb](https://github.com/ukrmaxim?tab=repositories).
